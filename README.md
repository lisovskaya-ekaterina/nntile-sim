- `main.py`:
  - Set the "name" of the algorithm in the variables `..._mode` for: the policy of data eviction from GPU memory, the policy of push a task to the worker, the policy of pop a task from the worker's queue.
  - Define a set of workers in the `workers` variable.
- `nntilesim/const.py`:
  - A place for any constants, including the "names" of modes for various policies.
- `nntilesim/Scheduler.py`:
  - It is possible to define a new policy (as a new function) for **selecting a best worker** and **determining a place in the worker's queue**.
  - In `push_task` function, add a switch for the algorithm if a new one is being created.
- `nntilesim/Worker.py`:
  - It is possible to define a new policy (as a new function) for **selecting a task from worker's queue** and for **eviction policy**.
  - In `pop_task` and `eviction` functions, add a switch for the algorithm if a new one is being created.
- `nntilesim/task_generator.py`:
  - Ð¡onverts the traces of real calculations into data for the simulator.
- `nntilesim/Task.py`:
  - Just a task data.
- `nntilesim/CPU.py`:
  - Just a unlimited memory of CPU.
